    <h1>IVY KINYANJUI</h1>
  </p> <strong>
        I will talk about who i think i am. I am the kind of girl who is quiet in large groups or around people i dont know.<br>
        You only see the real me if we are close. I smile and laugh a lot,especially at the most inappropriate times. Im a hopeless romantic <br>
        I trip over air,up stairs,and over people's feet.I am the hardest person to offend,but it is all too easy to make me feel horrible<br>
        I hate telling people my problems;they don't need to worry about me. <br>
        I'm the one who listens to other people's problems. I believe people should not be judged before one takes the time to get to know them <br>
        Yet i am guilty of doing that exact thing <br>
        I love to think rather than talk.<br>
        I'm awkward ,cllumsy,shy,strange but this is me. Take it leave it <br>

<h3>SPIRIT ANIMAL </h3>
<P> <strong>            
    My spirit animal is a butterfly since they are a remider of our own spiritual transformation. <br>
    Moreso, i view the butterfly as proof you can go through a great deal of darkness and still become something new. <br>
    I love the butterfly since it reminds us that its never too late to transform ourselves <br>
